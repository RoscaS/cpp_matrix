# generic 2D matrix class (exercise 7.3)
---------------------
Let's try to build a 2d matrix that is able to handle all sorts of types. The size of this bad guy is choosed by the user.

for example, he should be able to type in:

```c++
Matrix<float> m1(3, 4);
``` 

This instruction gonna create a Matrix that holds floats and is composed of 3 lignes and4 columns.

- linked list that store custom Shape type: [https://github.com/RoscaS/cpp_linkedList_shapes]()
